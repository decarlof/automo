Here an approach is demonstrated termed {\it Tomosaic} for tomographic imaging of large samples that extend beyond the illumination field of view of an X-ray imaging system. This includes software modules for image stitching and calibration, while making use of existing modules available in other packages for alignment and reconstruction. The approach is compatible with conventional beamline hardware, while providing a dose-efficient method of data acquisition. By using parallelization on a distributed computing system, it provides a solution for handling teravoxel-sized or larger datasets that cannot be processed on a single workstation in a reasonable time. Using experimental data, the package is shown to provide good quality three-dimensional reconstruction for centimetre-sized samples with sub-micrometre pixel size.},keywords = {X-ray tomography, image alignment, image reconstruction, parallelized computing},}@inproceedings{reference:03,author = {Ming Du and Rafael Vescovi and Ryan Chard and Narayanan Kasthuri and Chris Jacobsen and Eva Dyer and Do\u{g}a G\"{u}rsoy},booktitle = {Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics Congress 2018 (Microscopy/Translational/Brain/OTS)},journal = {Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics Congress 2018 (Microscopy/Translational/Brain/OTS)},keywords = {Blood; Tomography},pages = {BF4C.2},publisher = {Optical Society of America},title = {An automated pipeline for the collection, transfer, and processing of large-scale tomography data},year = {2018},url = {http://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?URI=BRAIN-2018-BF4C.2},doi = {10.1364/BRAIN.2018.BF4C.2},abstract = {We introduce an automated and scalable data collection, transfer, and processing pipeline for tomographic measurement of centimeter-sized mouse brains with sub-micrometer resolution.
